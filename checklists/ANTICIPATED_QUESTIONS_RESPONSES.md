## üí∞ **INVESTMENT & FINANCIAL QUESTIONS**

### **Q1: "What makes your ¬£150,000 funding requirement realistic?"**
**Strategic Response:**
"Our funding requirement is based on validated operational data. We've already demonstrated cost efficiency at ¬£0.08 per content piece versus the industry standard of ¬£2-5, representing 95% cost savings. With our Google Cloud system operating at 92.4% budget efficiency and generating 200+ pieces daily, we have proven unit economics. The ¬£150K covers 12 months to profitability: 40% for inventory (validated supplier relationships), 30% for marketing (Creator Fund strategy ready with 1,640+ pieces), 20% for key hires, and 10% for operations. Conservative projections show break-even by Month 10 with 65% gross margins."

### **Q2: "How do you justify a ¬£475M total addressable market?"**
**Strategic Response:**
"The ¬£475M figure comes from ONS wellness market data showing 15.8% CAGR growth. Our serviceable addressable market is ¬£47M in the terpene/aromatherapy segment, targeting 2.3M UK adults currently using anxiety management products. We're only claiming 1% market penetration by Year 3, which is ¬£4.7M revenue - extremely conservative given our competitive advantages. Our AI system alone provides content value equivalent to ¬£200K+ in professional services, and we're the first scientifically-validated terpene lifestyle brand in the UK."

### **Q3: "What happens if you don't reach projected growth rates?"**
**Strategic Response:**
"Our projections use conservative assumptions with multiple growth scenarios. If we achieve 50% of projections, we still reach profitability by Month 15 with the same funding. We have three revenue streams: D2C sales (primary), content licensing, and B2B partnerships. Our AI system provides built-in cost advantages that improve margins even at lower volumes. We also have pivot options including consulting services, white-label solutions, and focusing on higher-margin B2B markets. The technology platform scales efficiently, so slower growth doesn't proportionally increase costs."

### **Q4: "How will you compete with established wellness brands?"**
**Strategic Response:**
"Established brands lack our two key advantages: scientific credibility and AI-powered efficiency. Most wellness companies make generic claims without molecular-level education. We provide university-level scientific backing with 6-12 research citations per product. Our AI system generates content at ¬£0.08 per piece while competitors spend ¬£2-5, allowing us to outspend them 25:1 on customer education. We're also first-mover in terpene lifestyle branding - existing brands focus on CBD or general aromatherapy without the scientific precision we offer."

### **Q5: "What's your customer acquisition cost and lifetime value?"**
**Strategic Response:**
"Our CAC is projected at ¬£25-35 based on TikTok Creator Fund strategy. With 1,640+ pieces of Creator Fund-ready content, we can scale organic reach efficiently. LTV is ¬£180-250 based on average order values of ¬£45-75 and 4-5 purchases annually with 60% retention rates. This gives us a 5-7x LTV:CAC ratio. Our AI-generated educational content creates natural viral loops - customers share scientific terpene information, driving organic growth. The subscription model (launching Month 6) will increase LTV to ¬£300+ through recurring revenue."

## üß¨ **TECHNOLOGY & INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY QUESTIONS**

### **Q6: "How defensible is your AI technology?"**
**Strategic Response:**
"Our AI system combines three proprietary elements: terpene-specific content algorithms, quality scoring methodology, and automated video generation pipelines. We have 1,640+ pieces of training data specifically for botanical education, creating domain expertise other AI systems lack. The integration with Google Cloud Vertex AI and MedLM provides medical-grade content generation capabilities. While competitors could build basic content AI, replicating our terpene specialization, quality scoring (89% average), and Creator Fund optimization (78% readiness) would require 18+ months and significant investment."

### **Q7: "What prevents Google or other tech giants from copying your approach?"**
**Strategic Response:**
"Tech giants focus on general AI applications, not niche markets like terpene education. Our defensibility comes from market specialization, not just technology. We have domain expertise in botanical science, regulatory compliance (FSA/MHRA), and wellness consumer behavior that took years to develop. Our 87-strain database with molecular profiles represents significant research investment. Even if replicated, we have first-mover advantage and established supplier relationships. Our strategy is to build market leadership before tech giants notice this niche."

### **Q8: "How do you ensure AI-generated content is scientifically accurate?"**
**Strategic Response:**
"Our quality assurance has three layers: First, training data verified by botanical researchers with peer-reviewed citations. Second, automated quality scoring across 12 factors including molecular formula accuracy and regulatory compliance. Third, human review by our R&D team before publication. We maintain 89% content quality scores and zero regulatory violations. Each strain profile includes 6-12 scientific citations, and we're building partnerships with universities for ongoing validation. Medical content uses MedLM specifically for clinical accuracy."

### **Q9: "What's your intellectual property protection strategy?"**
**Strategic Response:**
"We're protecting IP through multiple approaches: Trade secrets for AI algorithms and quality scoring methodologies, trademarks for brand and product names, copyright for content libraries, and potential patents for novel terpene formulations. Our content database represents significant compilation IP. We maintain confidential proprietary formulations and supplier relationships. The combination of IP, first-mover advantage, and operational expertise creates a strong competitive moat even without broad patents."

### **Q10: "How scalable is your technology platform?"**
**Strategic Response:**
"Our Google Cloud architecture auto-scales based on demand. Current capacity is 200+ pieces daily, but we can scale to 1,000+ pieces with minimal cost increase due to our efficient algorithms. The system handles batch processing for multiple product lines, languages, and formats. Video generation scales similarly with automated workflows. Our cost per piece actually decreases with volume due to fixed infrastructure costs. We've designed for international expansion and multi-brand applications from the beginning."

## üè• **REGULATORY & COMPLIANCE QUESTIONS**

### **Q11: "How do you navigate UK regulatory requirements for wellness products?"**
**Strategic Response:**
"We've proactively built comprehensive regulatory compliance. All products focus on botanical terpenes, not controlled substances, staying within FSA and MHRA guidelines. We avoid medical claims, focusing on aromatherapy and wellness applications. Our content includes proper disclaimers and compliance language. We're working with regulatory consultants and have frameworks for labeling (CLP compliance), safety data sheets, and advertising standards. Every formulation includes safety documentation and we're prepared for regulatory reviews."

### **Q12: "What happens if regulations change or tighten?"**
**Strategic Response:**
"Regulatory changes are built into our risk management. We monitor FSA, MHRA, and ASA updates continuously. Our botanical focus provides safety buffer - terpenes are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) compounds. We can adapt formulations and messaging quickly with our AI system generating compliant content. If needed, we can pivot to pure aromatherapy applications or consulting services. Our scientific approach and proactive compliance actually position us better than brands making unsupported claims."

### **Q13: "How do you ensure product safety and quality control?"**
**Strategic Response:**
"Quality control operates at three levels: Supplier verification (GMP certification, CoA requirements), internal testing (third-party lab verification), and consumer safety monitoring. Every batch includes analytical testing for purity, potency, and contaminants. We maintain detailed quality documentation and traceability. Our suppliers provide certificates of analysis, and we conduct random verification testing. We have recall procedures and product liability insurance. The R&D team includes quality assurance expertise."

### **Q14: "What about advertising and marketing compliance?"**
**Strategic Response:**
"Our marketing strategy emphasizes education over claims. We focus on molecular science and aromatherapy applications rather than medical benefits. All content includes appropriate disclaimers and complies with ASA guidelines. Our AI system includes compliance checking to avoid problematic claims. We're building relationships with regulatory experts and have budget for compliance review. The educational approach actually provides competitive advantage while maintaining compliance."

## ü§ù **PARTNERSHIP & SUPPLIER QUESTIONS**

### **Q15: "How dependent are you on your primary supplier relationship?"**
**Strategic Response:**
"While Terpenes UK is our preferred partner, we've identified 2-3 backup suppliers to prevent single-source dependency. The terpene market has multiple quality suppliers globally. Our formulations use standard compounds available from multiple sources. We're structuring the Terpenes UK partnership with volume commitments but maintaining flexibility. If needed, we can source internationally with 30-60 day transition periods. Our AI-powered demand forecasting actually makes us an attractive customer for any supplier."

### **Q16: "What makes your supplier partnership valuable to them?"**
**Strategic Response:**
"We offer suppliers three key advantages: Predictable demand through AI-powered forecasting, premium brand positioning that supports higher prices, and co-marketing opportunities through our content platform. Our Year 1 target of ¬£150K represents significant volume for specialty suppliers. We're also collaborative partners in product development and quality optimization. The partnership helps position them as science-focused suppliers in a growing market. Our content system provides marketing value they can't generate internally."

### **Q17: "How do you plan to scale supplier relationships internationally?"**
**Strategic Response:**
"International expansion follows our market development. We'll establish regional supplier partnerships in each major market, starting with EU suppliers for European expansion. Our standardized quality requirements and AI-powered operations make supplier onboarding efficient. We can leverage existing relationships for introductions and maintain consistent quality standards globally. The technology platform handles multiple suppliers and regional compliance requirements. We plan 1-2 suppliers per region with backup relationships."

## üë• **TEAM & EXECUTION QUESTIONS**

### **Q18: "What's your plan for building the team?"**
**Strategic Response:**
"Our hiring strategy focuses on three key roles: COO for operations and scaling (Month 3), Head of Marketing for customer acquisition (Month 6), and part-time specialists in regulatory, quality, and customer service. We're leveraging advisory relationships and consultants initially to minimize fixed costs while building revenue. The technical team is established with CTO and R&D capabilities. We plan 8-10 team members by Year 2, scaling based on revenue milestones rather than funding availability."

### **Q19: "How do you handle key person risk with the founder?"**
**Strategic Response:**
"We're building systems and documentation to minimize key person dependency. The AI technology has multiple team members familiar with operations. Business processes are documented and our advisory board provides strategic continuity. We're establishing key person insurance and succession planning. The early COO hire will handle day-to-day operations, allowing focus on strategic growth. Our goal is building a business that can operate independently while maintaining founder strategic leadership."

### **Q20: "What's your experience in wellness/consumer products?"**
